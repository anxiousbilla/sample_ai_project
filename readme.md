### Getting to know Scikit Learn workflow:
1. Getting data ready (split into features and labels, prepare train and test steps)
2. Choosing a model for our problem (and setting hyperparameters)
3. Fit the model to the data and use it to make a prediction
4. Evaluate the model
5. Experiment to improve
6. Save a model for someone else to use
7. Putting it all together in a pipeline
